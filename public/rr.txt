#🧠💻🎤 BOKA BHAI
Full Name: Boka Bhai (alias: "The Legendary Code Guru of Mirpur")
Origin: Somewhere between "Bro, check this out" and "Wait, it works now?"

#Profession(s):

Frontend Dev (still using inline CSS because "who needs external files?")

JavaScript Magician (can turn a 1-line code into a 50-line disaster)

Self-Taught Designer (his design sense is 'asymmetric' for a reason)

Backend Biker (his server runs like a bike with a broken muffler)


#🚨 Backstory
Boka Bhai first learned to code by copying and pasting from Stack Overflow at 2 AM. After learning HTML, he claimed he was a “web designer” and that he’d “conquered CSS.” When told about frameworks, he simply said, “Too many dependencies, bhai, I’ll stick with tables.” He once tried to learn Git, but his first commit was literally just: "It works now, promise."

Fun Fact: His version of “debugging” involves restarting the computer three times and praying.

#🛠️ Skills

HTML/CSS (still wonders what Flexbox is)

JavaScript (his only knowledge is how to create an infinite loop)

React (he’s just waiting for it to make sense)

PHP (still using echo like it’s PHP 4)

GitHub (has 23 commits, 3 are “hello world”)

Photoshop (still uses 1998’s version because it has all the “cool effects”)


#💼 Startups & Projects
🌍 MyFirstWebsite.com
A website with a very questionable domain name, containing a single image of a cat and the text “Coming soon (but who knows when).”

🎮 GamerAPI
An API that gets your gaming stats, then crashes for no reason but says "Error 404: Player Not Found."

🖼️ DesignLikePro
A service that "automatically" generates your website layout using only Comic Sans and bright neon colors.

🛠️ CodeSnack
A snack delivery service that doesn’t deliver snacks but does send you a confusing error message after you press "Order."

#🎧 Gear & Look

Laptop: Crashes when it tries to open more than 2 tabs

Keyboard: Missing letters but makes him "unique"

Monitors: One is a 12-year-old CRT monitor

VS Code Theme: Bright neon (because "dark mode gives him headaches")


#🧃 Hobbies

Spamming random code snippets in Slack

Writing cryptic messages in Git commit history

Watching “How to Become a Full-Stack Developer” tutorials at 3 AM

Offering free advice on Stack Overflow, and then asking the same question himself

Staring at his screen and pretending to debug while actually Googling the issue
